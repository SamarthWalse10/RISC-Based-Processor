# RISC-Based-Processor-Verilog
RISC-based Basic Processor with Verilog Implementation and Python Assembler

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a RISC-based processor implemented using Verilog. The processor design includes a program memory, program counter, register file, ALU, data memory, and multiplexers. Additionally, a Python-based assembler is provided to convert assembly language programs into the corresponding instruction set for the processor.
## Features
Simple and efficient RISC-based processor implementation in Verilog.
Python assembler converts assembly language programs into the processor's instruction set.
Program memory to store instructions.
Program counter for tracking the currently executing instruction.
Register file to hold data.
ALU for performing arithmetic and logical operations.
Data memory for storage.
Multiplexers for selecting appropriate data or control signals
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamarthWalse10/RISC-Based-Processor.git
2. Open the processor.xpr file in processor folder using Xilinx Vivado Software.
3. You can change the Instructions set as per your use in program.asm file in processor_assembler folder.
4. Execute the program.py Python script present in processor_assembler folder.
5. Now Run Simulation and RTL Analysis in Xilinx Vivado to see Result.
